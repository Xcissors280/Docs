I made a simple server to render google docs as a nice documentation page

first make a google api service account and put its credentials.json file in the main directory
you might have to change the service account email adress in the html if is isnt automatic
then set your default document id in .env and server port in .env and server.us

finally install packages with npm install and start the server with npm start
